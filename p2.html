    <h3>What is Promise?</h3>
    <p>Promise is built in constructor of javascript</p>
     <p>A promise object represents an operation which has produced or will eventually produce a value.Promises provide a robust way to wrap the (possibly pending) result of asynchrous request</p>

     <h3>States of Promises</h3>
     <h5>1. Pending</h5>
     <p>The underlying operation has not yet completed or neither rejected</p>

     <h5>2. Fulfilled</h5>
     <p>The operation has finished and promise is fulfilled with a response. (.then()) is used handle fulfilled response.</p>

     <h5>3. Rejected</h5>
     <p>The error occured during the operation is rejected with a reason. (.catch()) is used to catch the error.</p>

     <h5>4. Settled</h5>
     <p>A promise a said to settled,(either resolved or rejected).Once the promise is settled,it becomes imutable.</p>

     <script>
        let x = 99;
        const myResponse = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
            if(x<100){
                resolve("Hi welcome to new promise response");
            }
            else{
                reject("Ooops sorry my value is meet the condition")
            }
        });

        myResponse.then(function(value){
            //fulfilled response
            alert(value);//if cond fullfilled it comes here
        }).catch(function(error){
            //rejected reason
            alert(error);
        });//if not fulfilled it comes under catch or error
     </script>
